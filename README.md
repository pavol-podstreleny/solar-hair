# Solar hair
Solar hair represents a static [website](https://solarhair.com) built for a local hair salon located in Taipei. 

Following technologies were used to develop the website:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Run the website
1) The first step is to clone the solar-hair repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pavol-podstreleny/solar-hair.git
```

2) Move inside the `solar-hair` folder and run:
```shell
npm run build
```
To run the `npm run build` command, you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (node package manager) that comes with node.js.

`nmp run build` runs [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that creates bundles.
Distribution `dist` folder is created and contains `index.html` that represent HTML website.

4) Open `index.html` in the browser.
